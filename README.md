# User Prediction Subscription Model 

**Research Question:**

*How can customer churn be accurately predicted using historical subscription and engagement data from a streaming service?*

**What Does Our Model Achieve:**

*The model identifies customers who are at risk of canceling their subscriptions (churning). By analyzing patterns in customer engagement and subscription behavior, the model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn.*

**SIRS Survey Completion & Demo Video & Project Document:**

*All Team Members completed the survey & Made a video for extra credit & have a project document.*
